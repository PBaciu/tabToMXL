# tabToMXL

# Introduction
The tabToMXL is a java application that can be downloaded on to a personal computer, which will convert tablature made for percussion, guitar, and bass guitar from a “.txt” format to a ".xml" format.

The specific xml format being used is musicxml and there are various resources on the web that will allow conversion from the resultant musicxml file into sheet music.

# Functionality
Currently, our application supports input in the form of plain text (pasted into a text box), or the selection of a .txt file from the user's file system.
The parser is a work in progress and no matter what input tab is submitted, one predetermined output will be generated.

# Setup
Outlined below are instructions for setting up the project in both IntelliJ and Eclipse.
